# PackageIt
Package your items into a sturdy cardboard ficsit box for convenient logistical transport/storage.  

Packaging ratio is 15:1, larger ratios can be individually unlocked per item in the MAM Research.  
Packaging requires a flat pack box which can be crafted with wood.  (Alternative wood recipes added)  
Pack and unpack your singular items in the vanilla Assembler machine.  

Adds a couple essential build boxes that can be packed in the Manufacturer and unpacked at any workbench.  

Recipes are split between two different milestones, unlocked at Tier 6 and Tier 9.  
Tier 6 - Contains packaging recipes for items from Tier 0-6. Unlocks 30:1 in the MAM.  
Tier 9 - Contains packaging recipes for items from Tier 7-9. Unlocks 50:1 in the MAM.  

No recipes are unlocked upon Milestone completion, you must research your desired recipe individually.  
This is to prevent recipe spam in the machines menu and only unlock recipes you actually use.
